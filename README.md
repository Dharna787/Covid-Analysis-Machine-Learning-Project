📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis (Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn)

This project presents a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global COVID-19 data using Python. It includes complete data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical insight generation.

🚀 Project Highlights

Imported and cleaned a dataset of 225 countries with 10 key COVID-19 metrics.

Handled missing values, fixed column encoding issues, and ensured dataset consistency.

Performed descriptive statistics and visualized:

Top & least affected countries (cases & deaths)

Death percentage comparison across nations  

Identified global outliers such as:

USA & India for highest total cases.

Yemen & Western Sahara for highest fatality rates.

Computed correlation between Total Cases and Deaths per 1M population, revealing a weak relationship (0.22).

📁 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📈 Key Insights

High case count does not always indicate high fatality rate.

Countries with limited healthcare infrastructure show disproportionately high death percentages.

Europe and Asia contribute the majority of global COVID-19 cases.

Visualizations reveal strong regional patterns and significant global variation.

📝 Conclusion

The project demonstrates how data cleaning and visualization can uncover meaningful trends in global health crises. This analysis gives clear insights into the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and continents.
